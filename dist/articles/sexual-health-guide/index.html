			<p>College comes with a whole slew of new things to worry about: classes, tough professors,
				midterms, the whole shebang. However, something that people often forget to worry about
				is sexual health. Since a lot of students have been with the same family doctor for
				most of their childhoods, the idea of seeking out a new doctor in the Evanston area may
				seem kind of daunting. However, there are many options for those who are looking.</p>

						'content':  '<p>Who doesn’t love Searle? While almost everyone has either heard a horror story about the beloved on-campus medical center, or personally experienced its wonders, it is still the most convenient, cost-effective resource on campus. In terms of sexual health, their services are actually pretty great: they offer everything from birth control to STI testing.</p>'+
						'<p>If you are covered by the Northwestern Health Insurance, they offer generic brands of birth control for no additional cost. A Plan B pill will cost you about $20 per dose, which is a lot cheaper than what you can find at most pharmacies – just bring your Wildcard. They also offer a variety of different STI tests, again covered by the Northwestern Health Insurance. If you have a different plan, the prices will range from $17 (syphilis) to $70 (HPV) – which is still cheaper than most clinics. Also, on the third floor of the Northwestern Medical Center is CARE, where the members of SHAPE operate – highly-trained, socially conscious peer educators who will take the time to talk you through the pros and cons of different birth control options, educate you on STIs and have access to a plethora of information and free supplies. They also have a table at either Norris or in front of old Kellogg every Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. if you are too busy to make a trip to Searle.</p>'+

						'content': '<p>If you are not covered by the Northwestern Health Insurance Plan, or if you are interested in getting an IUD, you might prefer to visit Planned Parenthood. The closest one is in Rogers Park, about 35 minutes away, on the red line - get off at Bryn Mawr. The IUD costs $848 at face value, but as you might know, Planned Parenthood operates on a pay-as-you-can basis, and takes most forms of insurance. They will tell you your expected contribution before your appointment if you call them (their number is 773-942-7193). As with Searle, Planned Parenthood offers STI testing, although it is slightly more expensive: according to the secretary at this branch, the tests range from $40-60 if you’re non-symptomatic.'+

						'content': '<p>Dr. Moloney is  a  local gynecologist in Evanston with a small practice located between Whole Foods and Chipotle. She is the one I personally went to my freshman year, after rave reviews from a friend. She offers free birth control consultations, and generally will spend about an hour in each consultation, going over your medical history, asking questions, and explaining the options available to ensure that you end up with the option best suited for you. She’s very friendly and honest, and well loved on Yelp. One <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/kimberly-moloney-md-evanston\">particularly enthusiastic review</a> reads, “TY Vagina Doctor u rock!!” Beyond her consultation, Dr. Moloney’s services are a bit more expensive than the other options on the list, so if you choose to see her for tests or get birth control from her, have your insurance information ready and check with her receptionist - she will let you know how much you are expected to pay.'+

They hold walk-in times Monday through Thursday from noon to 7 p.m., and on Fridays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and serve on a first-come first-served basis.
