			<p>According to a 2015 <a href=http://www.vrg.org/blog/2015/05/29/how-often-do-americans-eat-vegetarian-meals-and-how-many-adults-in-the-u-s-are-vegetarian-2/" target=_blank">Harris Poll</a>, only 3.4% of American adults eat no meat including fish; however, 36% of American adults eat at least one vegetarian meal a week.</p>
<p>Due to the abundance of vegans and vegetarians on campus, a particularly persuasive documentary, or just the sheer fact that the vegan/vegetarian lines in the dining hall are shorter, you may have considered turning towards a diet without meat or animal products. But, is it really healthy?</p>
<p>First, there are many different variations of the plant-based diet with the three most common being veganism (no animal products), vegetarianism (all animal products except meat or fish), and pescetarianism (fish and animal products but not meat).</p>
<p>Many <a href=https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian" target=_blank">health experts agree</a> that there are multiple health benefits to a more plant-based diet, including lower risk for cardiac events, cancer and type two diabetes.</p>
<p>According to a study by the <a href=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/5/1627S.full">American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</a>, vegans often have healthier weights, lower cholesterol and lower blood pressure which reduces their risk of heart disease. This is because vegans and vegetarians tend to stay away from high fat foods such as beef and other non-lean meats.</p><p>"Overall, I generally feel like my diet is healthier because most of the meat I ate was bacon and hotdogs and stuff anyway, so I cut a lot of fat out," said Communication freshman Sophia Blake, who has been a vegetarian for almost five years.</p><p>However, a worry many non-meat eaters may have is not getting the proper nutrition. You could technically eat cookies all day and still be vegetarian, but you would not receive the same health benefits as people like Cohen, who eat veggies and health foods. Some of the most common<a href=http://www.eatright.org/resource/food/nutrition/vegetarian-and-special-diets/food-sources-of-important-nutrients-for-vegetarians" target=_blank"> nutrients</a> missing for vegetarians are iron and protein. Iron can be found in beans, dark leafy greens and some fortified cereals. Vegetarians can get their protein fix with beans, soy, eggs or dairy.</p>
<p>"I definitely feel more alert and healthy since becoming vegan," said SESP freshman Sydney Cohen. "Being vegan has also made me try a lot of new healthy food like quinoa and different veggies."</p> <p>Vegans, however, can have an even harder time finding certain nutrients typically found in dairy products, such as calcium, Vitamin B12 or Vitamin D. Some ways to get vitamins B12 and D are through fortified foods such as cereal, soy milk and more (just be sure to check the label!). Calcium can also be found in some fortified foods, but is more prevalent in leafy greens, broccoli and almonds.</p>
<p>To remedy this, Sodexo consultant dietitian Pam Lugthart recommends transitioning gradually. "I recommend to start by substituting one or two meat containing meals per week with meatless meals. Once that is established, one can continue eliminating animal products from their diet until they reach their goal," she says," If someone wants to become vegan, I recommend that they consult with a dietitian to assure they are getting adequate nutrients in their diet."</p>
<p>For Northwestern students, eating vegan or vegetarian can be a daunting task, but all dining halls always provide a vegan option. In order to stay healthy and get all the nutrients you need, stick to the salad bar and those vegan options. However, if you're feeling like splurging, pasta, grilled cheese and pizza are all frequent vegetarian options in the dining halls - just be sure to not rely on these options all the time.When going out into Evanston, you can try places with vegan options such as Blaze Pizza, FlatTop Grill, Olive Mediterranean Grill and the sorbet at Forever Yogurt.</p>
<p>So, if you decide to try the vegan or vegetarian lifestyle at NU, remember to eat your greens!</p>
