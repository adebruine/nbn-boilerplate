			<p> As someone who’s had five bad colds, mono and an unexplainable ulcer all since
				arriving on campus a year and a half ago, I’d like to say I’m pretty experienced
				in where to go when you’re not feeling too great. Since my regular doctors are over
				 1,000 miles away, navigating where I should go in Evanston for both minor and serious
				  health problems has caused many meltdowns and panicked calls to my mother. To save
					you (and your parents) from that unneeded stress, I’ve created your guide to
					getting sick on campus. </p>
<p> <strong> Northwestern University Health Services in Searle Hall </strong> </p>
<p> This should be your first stop if you’re feeling a little sick, from a virus to a cold to strep. Any Northwestern student is eligible to use Searle’s health services. Nurses can test and treat you for an illness, injury or sexual health issues, as well as administer vaccines. Searle is also where you go to get your blood drawn if you participate in the mono research study. (Because if you’re going to get mono, you might as well earn $160 from it!) You can call at 847-491-2204 for an appointment or make one <a href="https://www-healthy.nuhs.northwestern.edu/login_directory.aspx" target="_blank"> online</a> if it’s non-urgent. Appointments can sometimes be difficult to come across, especially during flu season, so I recommend scheduling Searle visits as soon as you start feeling badly – you can always cancel free of charge up until two hours prior to your appointment. Searle is open 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, and open 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Tuesdays. On Saturdays, the center is open from 9-11:30 a.m. for urgent care only. If you need to see a doctor after hours, students are encouraged to go to Northwestern Medicine Immediate Care. If you’re on the Northwestern Student Health Insurance plan, you won’t be charged for visiting another health center when Searle is closed. </p>

<p> <strong> Northwestern Medicine Immediate Care </strong> </p>
<p> For after Searle’s hours, or if your insurance covers it, Northwestern Medicine Immediate Care is located in downtown Evanston at 1704 Maple Avenue. Personally, I’ve received excellent care during my doctor&#x27;s visits at this immediate care center. (The doctors knew I had mono when I didn’t even show symptoms!) They can test and treat you for any illness like the flu, strep or mono; draw and test your blood; or refer you to other speciality doctors if necessary for more serious illnesses. Northwestern Medicine Immediate Care is open every day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and walk-ins are welcome. </p>

<p> <strong> Presence Saint Francis Hospital </strong> </p>
<p> For emergencies, or if you need to see a specialty doctor, Presence Saint Francis is the closest hospital to campus. Located at 355 Ridge Avenue in Evanston, only about a 10-minute drive from campus, this is the best place to go for after-hours emergencies or more serious health conditions. Side note: This hospital is huge. If you have an appointment to see a specialty doctor, plan on getting there 15 minutes early to navigate the twisting hallways and many, many offices. </p>

<p> <strong> CVS </strong> </p>
<p> For any prescriptions or over-the-counter medicine purchases, the CVS at 1711 Sherman Avenue in downtown Evanston is the best and closest place to go. The store is open everyday from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., but beware: The pharmacy is only open from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays. The store sells all items needed to fight off just about any illness, from allergy medicine to pain relievers to cough medicine to decongestants. Plus, there are multiple aisles with snacks and candies – which, let’s be honest, we all deserve when we’re not feeling so great. </p>

<p> Hopefully you won’t ever need this guide, but if you ever find yourself down with the Northwestern plague, with the help of the places on this list, you’re sure to be feeling better and back to the grind in no time. </p>
